c gives you a lot more control over how your computer program uses the computers memory.

pointer is adress of a piece of data in memory.

reasons why pointer is used
    1.instead of passing around the whole copy of data,you can just pass a pointer.
    2.You might want two pieces of code to work on the same 
    piece of data rather than a separate copy.

    Every time you declare a variable, the computer creates  space for it somewhere in memory. If  you declare a variable inside a function like main(), the computer 
    will store it in a section of  memory called the stack. If a variable is declared outside any function, it will be stored 
    in the globals section of  memory.
