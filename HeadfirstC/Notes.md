programmming is manupilating system hardware to do desired task pr job.

c - is a langugae for small and fast programms.

    is designed to run fast and small programms, compared to other languages C is lowest-level,it creats a code that is very close to what machine understands.

    computers doesnt really understands c code rather machine code that is 1 and 0 which terms as binary codes. so to make our c code native to the machine we need a compiler(translator) which converts our c code to machine languge .

    c is used where speed,compatiblity, space, portablity are matter or important

    most operating systems, most computer languages and most software games are written in c so its the most fundemental and cross platform low level language.

    there are three standards

    ANSI c(late 1980s) - is used for oldest code
    c99( from 1999)
    c11(realeased 2011)
